After running the bash script:

***Execution time results for 1 thread***
NUMT = 1
For 1 threads, Peak Performance =   174.01 MegaMults/Sec

***Execution time results for 4 threads***
NUMT = 4
For 4 threads, Peak Performance =   685.11 MegaMults/Sec

685.11 / 174.01 = Speedup

Speedup = 3.937

Parallel-Fraction = (4 / 3) * (1 - (1/Speedup))

Parallel-Fraction = 0.994666
